# networklists_contest
Funny client-server development based in node to be used in a devops contest

A .env file is required containing 3 key-value pairs:
  SECTION=<.edgerc section>
  NL_IP=<IP Network List ID>
  NL_GEO=<GEO Network List ID>

Server is running by default in port 4000. Change it in index.js.
